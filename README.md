This repository includes code that interacts between Python and C.

The main purpose is to demonstrate that Python is capable of handling pointers passed
from C modules and vice versa.

The type of pointers are not restricted to primitive types, such as int, char or string,
our experiment shows that we can pass numpy arrays by reference.
